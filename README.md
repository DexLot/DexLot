### DexLot

DexLot is a **decentralized** and **fully automated** token launchpad. We currently support the 5 most popular chains: Binance, Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon.

Our hopes were to create a launchpad that was finally viable to be used on the Ethereum network, and easier to use than all other launchpads. With our contract optimizations, **we can guarantee the cheapest transaction fees across all launchpad platforms.** We're 3x cheaper than PinkSale, and 40x cheaper than DXSale in terms of transaction costs.

We highly suggest reading our docmentation before creating a presale, especially if you are not already familiar with the process and requirements.

Our Github contains the source code to our docs, test-swap platform, and some contracts for token creators to easily create presale-ready tokens. In this case, presale-ready means it contains functions to whitelist addresses from fees and code to lock trading until the creator has fully finalized their presale. This will prevent other individuals from adding liquidity before the creator is ready.

We wish everyone the best of luck!
